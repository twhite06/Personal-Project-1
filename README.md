 ** IMPORTANT NOTE **
 
    This game is currently in the process of being used as a project assignment for the Introduction to Computer Science Course at Tufts University. The audience that this trivia game targets will likely have emotional memories triggered from the character names of their favorite cartoons as a kid. Emotional learning has been proven to be the best way of learning, so students can understand the main concepts implemented in the project ( Arrays, lists, file io, etc.) in a fun and extremely efficient way!
